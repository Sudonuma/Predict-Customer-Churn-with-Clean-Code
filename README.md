# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. 
The project have the EDA and feature engineering required to train the models.
Results of the EDA are saved under 'images/eda'
The models inculded in the package under '/models' directory are .pkl files saved after training with the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic regression.
The completed project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package can be run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites

Before starting please make sure to install these libraries:

```
joblib
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
pylint

```

## Running Files
To use the fucions import the churn_library module in your script.

`import churn_library as cls`

The project also includes unit tests for each function.
To run the tests run the following command:

` ipython churn_script_logging_and_test.py`
